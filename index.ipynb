    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we will consider a general-purpose simulation approach to estimating the power of an experimental design. Power analysis is an important aspect of experimental design. It allows us to determine the sample size required to detect an effect of a given size with a given degree of confidence. In other words, it allows us to determine the probability of detecting an effect of a given size with a given level of confidence, under sample size constraints. If this probability is unacceptably low, we would be wise to alter or abandon the experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following four factors have an intimate relationship:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sample size\n",
    "* Effect size\n",
    "* Significance level = P (Type I error) = probability of finding an effect that is not there\n",
    "* **Power = 1 - P (Type II error)** = probability of finding an effect that is there\n",
    "\n",
    "Given any three of these, we can easily determine the fourth.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",

    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Describe the concept of “Power” in relation to p-value and effect size for hypothesis testing\n",
    "* Understand and critically evaluate the factors influencing the power of an experiment\n",
    "* Perform Power calculation using SciPy and Python\n",
    "* Demonstrate the impact of sample size on statistical power using simulations\n",

    "A researcher wants to study how daily protein supplementation in the elderly population will affect baseline liver fat. The study budget will allow enrollment of 24 patients. Half will be randomized to a placebo group and half to the protein supplement treatment group and the trial will be carried out over one month. It is desired to see whether the mean change in percentage of liver fat from baseline to the end of the study differs between the two groups in the study. \n",

We can conclude this lesson with the ideas that a) Statistical power increases as we increase the sample size and b) with a small effect size, we require a large number of samples to achieve required power and vice versa.
